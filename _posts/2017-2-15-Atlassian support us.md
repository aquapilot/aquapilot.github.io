Well as you may know Atlassian is company that build (in my opinion) the best tools for developers. They provide almost all their tool for free when it is used for an OpenSource project. Exactly what AquaPilot is.

So I wanted to say : Thank you Atlassian ! Because with you we gonna have good and professionals tools to develop this open source project in the best conditions we could have.

Please continue to help the open source community like you do it's just amazing :)
