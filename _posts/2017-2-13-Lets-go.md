Hello,

As many of you I suppose I wanted to develop a monitoring tool for my aquaponic system. The main idea I had in focus was
to simply alert me when I have to adjust the water level, need to program my lighting in an other way to achieve better results and so on.

After a week I achieved a first prototype and published it on a facebook group called "Aquaponics" and there I have seen a huge interest for it.

So I decided to publish it as an open source project.

Any help is welcome and in the following days I will publish more of the code into the github repositories. If you are not a developper I have to tell you that it will not be usable before 1 or 2 months. It was really a *draft* proof of concept that need a lot of improvements before being usable for everybody.
