Hello my name is SÃ©bastien (alias Seb). I am a software engineer working in Switzerland and I am a big fan of Aquaponic systems.

I started this project the 18th january 2017 in my free time. I had a small aquaponic prototyp in my appartment and I wanted to add some tools to help me to reduce the human job in this system.

I started with an RaspberryPi 3 and a good old arduino uno. It worked pretty well and I decided to publish it as an open-source project. The idea behind this decision is that everyone around the world could contribute and use it. That way we can build a great stuff all together.
